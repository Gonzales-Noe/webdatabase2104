                <p class="laman-1">Possessing a fundamental understanding of network security is crucial to prevent viruses or 
                    unauthorized intrusions that could potentially harm your devices and compromise your personal safety.</p>

                <h4>Transmission Media Security:</h4>
                <p class="laman-1">For wired networks, implement robust encryption like WPA2 to ensure data confidentiality. 
                    Wireless networks, reliant on radio waves or infrared signals, benefit from strong encryption (e.g., WPA3), 
                    regular password updates, and firewalls for access control, mitigating unauthorized access risks.</p>
                <h4>Hardware Security</h4>
                    <p class="laman-1">Secure network hardware components by changing default router credentials, enabling 
                        strong authentication, and regular firmware updates. Switches enhance security with VLANs for traffic 
                        segregation and disabled unused ports. Servers require robust access controls, software updates, and 
                        intrusion detection. Firewalls, acting as gatekeepers, filter traffic, establish rules, and undergo regular 
                        updates for threat prevention.</p>
                <div class="security2">

                </div>
                <h4>Software Security</h4>
                    <p class="laman-1">Network management software should utilize secure communication, undergo regular updates, 
                        and enforce strong authentication. Network security software requires frequent updates for threat prevention. 
                        Network simulation software, for testing, should replicate actual security configurations.</p>

                <h4>Simple Things You Can Do</h4>
                    <p class="laman-1">Learn how to keep things safe online by following simple rules, like using strong passwords 
                        and being aware of the dangers of unauthorized access.</p>

                    <h4>REMEMBER!</h4>
                    <p class="laman-1">The integration of transmission media, hardware, and software not only forms the foundational 
                        structure of a network but also serves as a powerful tool for ensuring network security. These components act 
                        as both the building blocks that construct the network and the means by which security is reinforced, creating 
                        a resilient and protective environment for effective communication and optimized performance. Moreover, the more 
                        awareness you earn and apply in network learning, the more safety you gain—underscored by the principle that 
                        knowledge without application is akin to a network without security measures.
